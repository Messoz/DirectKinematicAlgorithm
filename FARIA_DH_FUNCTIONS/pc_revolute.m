%PC_REVOLUTE Computes the relative coordinate frame transformation based on
%two lines. Each line is specified by a direction vector (n) and a
%contained point (c).
%
%Dual Vector Geometry is used to identify the relationship between lines:
%parallel, intersect or skewed, and to compose the relative coordinate
%frame, accordingly.
